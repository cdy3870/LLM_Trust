These droplets then grow and merge to form larger droplets, which eventually become too heavy to remain suspended in the air and fall as rain.

While populism can be a force for positive change, particularly when it challenges corrupt or entrenched power structures, it can also be dangerous when it exploits people's fears and becomes a vehicle for authoritarian or nationalist agendas.
